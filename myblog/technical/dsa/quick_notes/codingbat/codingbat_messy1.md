# allSwap  

We'll say that 2 strings "match" if they are non-empty and their first chars are the same. Loop over and then return the given array of non-empty strings as follows: if a string matches an earlier string in the array, swap the 2 strings in the array. When a position in the array has been swapped, it no longer matches anything. Using a map, this can be solved making just one pass over the array. More difficult than it looks.

```
allSwap(["ab", "ac"]) → ["ac", "ab"]
allSwap(["ax", "bx", "cx", "cy", "by", "ay", "aaa", "azz"]) → ["ay", "by", "cy", "cx", "bx", "ax", "azz", "aaa"]
allSwap(["ax", "bx", "ay", "by", "ai", "aj", "bx", "by"]) → ["ay", "by", "ax", "bx", "aj", "ai", "by", "bx"]
```
### Solution Approach
//scan each element
// add first char of that element with index to map
// if that char already exists
// fetch the corresponding index
// swap the array's i with that index value
// remove the key from the map


# firstSwap
We'll say that 2 strings "match" if they are non-empty and their first chars are the same. Loop over and then return the given array of non-empty strings as follows: if a string matches an earlier string in the array, swap the 2 strings in the array. A particular first char can only cause 1 swap, so once a char has caused a swap, its later swaps are disabled. Using a map, this can be solved making just one pass over the array. More difficult than it looks.

firstSwap(["ab", "ac"]) → ["ac", "ab"]
firstSwap(["ax", "bx", "cx", "cy", "by", "ay", "aaa", "azz"]) → ["ay", "by", "cy", "cx", "bx", "ax", "aaa", "azz"]
firstSwap(["ax", "bx", "ay", "by", "ai", "aj", "bx", "by"]) → ["ay", "by", "ax", "bx", "ai", "aj", "bx", "by"]

//scan each element
   // add first char of that element with index to map
   // if that char already exists
    // fetch the corresponding index
      // if index!=-1
        // swap the array's i with that index value
        // update the index to -1 for that firstChar so that we don't swap for that
