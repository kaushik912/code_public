## 🔹 Core Mock Interview Prompt (copy–paste)

```
Act as a senior software engineer at a product-based company (FAANG-level).
Take a realistic technical interview for a Software Engineer role.

Rules:
- Ask ONE question at a time.
- Wait for my response before continuing.
- If my answer is unclear or incorrect, challenge it like a real interviewer.
- Focus on problem-solving, edge cases, and reasoning (not just final code).
- Do not help unless I explicitly ask for a hint.
- After each question, briefly evaluate my answer (strengths + gaps).

Interview format:
1) Problem understanding & clarifying questions
2) Approach & complexity
3) Code (language: Java)
4) Edge cases & optimizations
5) Follow-up / variations

Start with a DSA question of medium difficulty.
```

This alone is already **much better than generic “interview me” prompts**.

## 🔹 Variant 1: First-Round / Screening Interview

Use this when you want **arrays, strings, sliding window, hashing** (your current focus).

```
Act as an interviewer for a first-round software engineering interview.
Focus on arrays, strings, and basic data structures.

Constraints:
- Medium difficulty
- Time pressure simulation
- Ask follow-up questions if I finish early
- Penalize brute force or overengineering

Language: Java
Start now.
```

## 🔹 Variant 2: Behavioral + Technical Mix

```
Conduct a 45-minute mock interview for a Software Engineer role.

Structure:
- 5 minutes: behavioral
- 30 minutes: DSA problem
- 10 minutes: optimization & follow-ups

Be strict but fair. Push back if my explanations are weak.
Do not reveal the optimal solution unless I get stuck.

Start with a behavioral question.
```

## 🔹 Variant 3: “Silent Interviewer” (very realistic)

This one feels *uncomfortable* — which is good.

```
Take a mock DSA interview.
Do NOT guide me unless I explicitly ask.
Only answer clarification questions.
Point out mistakes but do not fix them for me.

Start with a medium DSA problem.
```

## 🔹 How to use ChatGPT mocks effectively (important)

### ❌ Don’t do this

* Ask for solution too early
* Let ChatGPT “coach” you while solving
* Copy-paste code without explaining

### ✅ Do this instead

1. **Think out loud** (write reasoning, not just code)
2. State time & space complexity
3. Explicitly mention edge cases
4. Ask clarifying questions like you would in real interview

Example:

```
I will first clarify constraints.
Then I’ll explain a brute-force approach, followed by an optimized one.
```

This trains **interview muscle memory**, not just correctness.

---

## 🔹 After-interview reflection prompt (very powerful)

After finishing a mock, run:

```
Evaluate my interview performance honestly.
- What went well?
- Where would an interviewer lose confidence?
- What should I practice next?
- Was my communication strong enough?

Be blunt.
```
