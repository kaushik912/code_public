## 🧠 Understanding AI and Related Terms

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

> The broad field where machines perform tasks that typically require **human-like intelligence**.

**Machine Learning (ML)**

> A subfield of AI where machines **learn from data** to make **future predictions**.

**Deep Learning (DL)**

> A further subfield within ML that **mimics the human brain** using **neural networks**.
> Common applications include:
>
> * Object recognition
> * Language translation
> * Speech processing

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

> Enables machines to **understand and process human language** — both text and speech.
> This advancement paved the way for **Generative AI (GenAI)**.

## ⚙️ Traditional Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather relevant datasets.
2. **Data Preparation** – Clean and remove junk data.
3. **Split the Data** –

   * 80% for **training**
   * 20% for **testing**
4. **Select an Algorithm** – Choose one that fits the problem type.
5. **Train the Model** – Teach it using the training data.
6. **Test the Model** – Validate accuracy with the testing data.
7. **Tune & Deploy** – Optimize for performance and push to production.

## ✨ Generative AI vs Traditional ML

| Traditional ML                     | Generative AI                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Predicts outcomes based on data    | **Generates new content** (text, images, code, etc.) |
| Example: Predicting housing prices | Example: Writing an article, creating an image       |

**Example:**
OpenAI’s **GPT** model — *Generative Pre-trained Transformer* — is a leading example of Generative AI.

## 🚀 Popular GenAI Models

| Model       | Purpose                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| **GPT**     | Text generation              |
| **DALL·E**  | Image generation             |
| **Whisper** | Audio and speech recognition |

* **ChatGPT** – Browser-based interface, ideal for **individual workflows**.
* **OpenAI API** – Lets you **integrate AI models** into your own **products or customer experiences**.

---

## 🧩 Libraries & Tools

* **Official OpenAI Library** – Available for **Python**
* Also supported in **JavaScript (JS)**

> These make it easy to integrate and experiment with AI models programmatically.

---

## 🤖 Other Large Language Models (LLMs)

* **Google Gemini** – Google’s family of advanced LLMs
* **LangChain** – Framework that simplifies switching between different LLMs

---

## 💻 Open Source LLMs

Examples include:

* **Llama** (Meta)
* **Gemma** (Google)
* **Mistral**

> These can even run **locally** on your own machine.

| Model          | Parameters | Approx. RAM Needed |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Llama 3.1 – 8B | 8 B        | ~8 GB              |
| Gemma – 2B     | 2 B        | ~2 GB              |
| Mistral – 7B   | 7 B        | ~8 GB              |
| 13 B models    | 13 B       | ~16 GB             |
| 33 B models    | 33 B       | ~32 GB             |

🧩 “B” = **Billion parameters**
➡️ Larger models = more memory required
