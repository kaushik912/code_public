| Everyday Activity | Scientific Principle | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Cooking pasta in boiling water | Heat Transfer (Convection) | The heat from the stovetop transfers through the water to the pasta evenly, causing it to cook throughout. |
| Using a microwave to heat food | Electromagnetic Radiation | Microwaves excite water molecules in the food, causing them to vibrate and generate heat. |
| Driving a car with brakes | Friction | When you press the brake pedal, friction between the brake pads and the wheels slows the car down. |
| Washing clothes with soap | Chemical Reaction (Emulsification) | Soap molecules break down dirt particles by surrounding them and allowing them to be rinsed away with water. |
| Checking body temperature with a thermometer | Thermal Expansion | The liquid in the thermometer expands as it absorbs heat from your body, indicating your temperature.

Science is all around us. Examples of science can be observed from the time we wake up till we go to sleep and even while one is sleeping.

Science influences most aspects of everyday life, including food, energy, medicine, transportation and leisure activities.

How science is involved in daily life?

* Even in our sleep our body is working continuously. We also see dreams in our sleep.

* When we eat food, our digestive system is at work.

* Medicine, vessels and furniture we use are the products of science.


# Benefits of boiling water

* Destroys germsâ€ƒ
* Improves digestion
* Prevents us from the infection of waterborne diseases
