# Deep Dive into Each Step

### 1. Client sends login credentials to `/token`

* Client (Postman or browser) sends username and password.
* This is public and does not require token.

### 2. Auth Server validates credentials

* Check username/password with your user store (DB or in-memory).
* If invalid, reject request with 401.

### 3. Auth Server creates JWT signed with Private Key

* Server builds a JWT payload (e.g. username, roles, expiry).
* It **signs** this token using the **private RSA key**.
* Private key must be kept secret; only the server knows it.

### 4. Auth Server sends JWT token in response

* Client receives a compact JWT token string.
* This token represents proof that the user is authenticated.

### 5. Client sends protected API request with JWT token

* Client calls protected endpoint `/profile`.
* Sends the token in the HTTP `Authorization` header:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
  ```

### 6. Server extracts token from request

* Spring Security intercepts request with a filter.
* Extracts the token from the header.

### 7. Server validates the JWT token using the Public Key

* Server uses the **public RSA key** to verify the token’s signature.
* This ensures token was signed by your server (private key owner).
* Also checks token expiration and claims.

### 8. If token is valid, allow access

* Token is genuine and not expired.
* Spring Security sets user as authenticated in the security context.
* Protected endpoint logic runs.

### 9. If token invalid or missing, reject with 401 Unauthorized

* Token fails signature check or is expired.
* Server denies access.

### 10. Server returns protected data or error

* Returns user profile or protected info.
* Or returns 401 Unauthorized.

# Why the Public/Private Keys?

* **Private key:** Signing is a *secret* operation — must be kept safe on the auth server.
* **Public key:** Verification is *safe to share* — resource servers or microservices use this to verify tokens without needing the private key.
* This improves security and scalability:

  * Private key never leaves auth server.
  * Multiple services can verify tokens with the public key.

# Bonus: Key Concepts Recap

| Concept              | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| JWT (JSON Web Token) | Compact token containing user info and signature         |
| Signature            | Proves token was created by someone with the private key |
| Private Key          | Secret key used to sign JWT, known only by auth server   |
| Public Key           | Publicly available key used to verify JWT signature      |
| Bearer Token         | Token passed in HTTP header to authorize requests        |
| Expiration           | JWT tokens have expiry time to limit validity            |
