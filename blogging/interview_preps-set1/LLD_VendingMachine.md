### Vending Machine System - Requirements Document

#### **Objective**
Design and implement a **Vending Machine** system that allows users to purchase items, handle payments, and manage inventory efficiently. The system should be designed using appropriate **design patterns** to ensure scalability and maintainability.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **1. User Interaction**
- The vending machine should start in an idle state, waiting for user input.
- Users should be able to insert money and select an item from the vending machine.
- The machine should return change if the user overpays.
- If an item is out of stock, the machine should notify the user.

#### **2. Inventory Management**
- The system should maintain an inventory of available items and update stock accordingly.
- Items should not be dispensed if they are out of stock.
- The system should provide an alert when inventory levels are low.

#### **3. Payment Processing**
- The system should support multiple payment methods (e.g., cash, card, mobile payment).
- The vending machine should validate payments before dispensing an item.
- If the payment is insufficient, the user should be prompted to insert more money.

#### **4. Machine States**
- The vending machine should transition between different states based on user interactions:
  - **Idle State** – Waiting for user selection.
  - **Money Inserted State** – User has inserted money and must select an item.
  - **Dispensing State** – The machine is dispensing an item.
  - **Out of Stock State** – The selected item is unavailable.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- The system should be **extensible**, allowing new items and payment methods to be added easily.
- The machine should provide **real-time feedback** to users (e.g., displaying available items, change returned).
- The system should **log important events** such as low inventory alerts.
- The solution should be designed for **efficient resource management** to handle concurrent users.

---


### **Expected User Flow**
1. The user inserts money into the vending machine.
2. The system validates the payment.
3. The user selects an item.
4. If the item is available:
   - The machine dispenses the item.
   - The system updates inventory.
   - Change is returned if applicable.
5. If the item is out of stock:
   - The system notifies the user and prompts for a different selection.
