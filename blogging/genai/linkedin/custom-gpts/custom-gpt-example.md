awesome — let’s switch the example to a **Java Best Practices** handbook you can upload as the GPT’s Knowledge file. I’ll give you:

1. a ready-to-use **Markdown document** (copy → save as `java-best-practices.md`)
2. quick **no-code steps** to build the custom GPT around it
3. a tiny **test plan** + sample Q&A so you can verify grounding

---

# 1) The file you’ll upload

**`java-best-practices.md`**

---

# 2) Build the custom GPT (no code)

1) **Open GPT Builder**  
   ChatGPT sidebar → **Explore GPTs** → **Create a GPT**.

2) **Configure → Name & Description**  
   - **Name:** `Java Best Practices Assistant`  
   - **Description:** “Answers Java development questions using the attached Java Best Practices Handbook.”

3) **Configure → Instructions** (paste this)
```

You are Java Best Practices Assistant.

Rules:

* Answer strictly from the attached “Java Best Practices Handbook (2025 Edition)” unless the user explicitly asks for general advice.
* If the handbook does not cover something, say: “I’m not sure — that isn’t covered in the handbook.”
* Cite the section or heading you used, like: (Source: §12 Testing Strategy).
* Prefer concise, practical guidance with short code samples when helpful.
* If the user pastes code, point out concrete improvements aligned with the handbook.

````

4) **Configure → Knowledge → Upload file**  
Upload `java-best-practices.md`.

5) **Capabilities**  
- Turn **off** web browsing (keeps it grounded to the file).  
- Leave others off unless you need them.

6) **Conversation Starters** (optional)  
- “How should I structure exception handling?”  
- “What’s the recommended way to use Optional?”  
- “Give me a checklist before merging a PR.”

7) **Save** and choose visibility (private / link).

# 3) Quick test plan (verifies it’s grounded)

Ask these and check it cites the right sections:

- **“Should I use Optional for fields?”**  
Expect: “No—Optional only as a return type…” *(Source: §3 Nulls, Optionals, and Contracts)*

- **“What should I log when charging a payment?”**  
Expect: parameterized logs, correlation IDs, no PII *(Source: §9 Logging, Observability, Resilience)*

- **“How big should my thread pool be?”**  
Expect: depends on CPU vs I/O; guidance + timeouts *(Source: §5 Concurrency & Parallelism)*

- **“Is LinkedList good for general use?”**  
Expect: rarely; prefer ArrayList *(Source: §4 Collections & Streams)*

- **“How do we handle DB migrations?”**  
Expect: use Flyway/Liquibase, no ad-hoc changes *(Source: §6 I/O, HTTP, and Persistence)*

- **Out-of-scope probe:**  
“What’s new in Java 23 virtual threads on platform X?” → should answer it’s not in the handbook unless you let it generalize.

## Sample Q&A (what good looks like)

**You:** “What are the rules around using Optional?”  
**Assistant:**  
Use `Optional` **only as a return type**, not for fields or parameters. Don’t return `null`; prefer `Optional.empty()`. Validate `null` early at module boundaries. *(Source: §3 Nulls, Optionals, and Contracts)*

**You:** “How should I log payment attempts?”  
**Assistant:**  
Use SLF4J with parameterized logs; include order/correlation IDs, exclude PII, and log once at the appropriate layer. Example:  
```java
log.info("Charge initiated orderId={} amount={} currency={}", orderId, amount, currency);
````

*(Source: §9 Logging, Observability, Resilience)*

## Maintenance tips

* When you revise the handbook, upload the updated `.md` and **Save**—no need to rebuild.
* Keep the handbook focused (remove duplicates), and use clear section headings so the GPT can cite them.
