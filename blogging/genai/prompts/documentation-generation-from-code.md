# Approach
- open a code base which has good samples
- ask claude 3.7 sonnet or equivalent model to summarize any specific functionality.
- Example: `@workspace provide a technical guide for publisher logic in this code. Capture important code snippets, linked file references, annotations and property files.`
- Remove anything specific to application and capture the key code snippets.
- This approach works great for Java based projects.
