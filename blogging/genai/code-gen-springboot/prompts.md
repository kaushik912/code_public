## Spring Boot Prompt1
```
I want you to act as a Java Spring Boot developer. Generate a complete Spring Boot application using Maven with the following requirements: 1. Create a `HelloController` class that exposes a REST API at `/hello`. 2. When accessed via GET, the endpoint should return the message \"Hello, World!\". 3. Include all necessary files like `pom.xml`, main application class, and controller. 4. The project should follow standard Spring Boot structure. 5. Use Java 17 and Spring Boot 3. 6. Make the application runnable with `mvn spring-boot:run`.
```
