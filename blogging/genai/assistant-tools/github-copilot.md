1. github copilot demonstration of a good concept like boiler plate code generation,etc.

# Agent mode
- Available in VSCode insiders that has access to agent mode.

## Vue Agent Example
- create an app using vue. use the current directory.
- remove the default component. Add a new component for creating a new user.
- update to have a modern feel and onboarding flow

## React Agent Example
- create a tic-tac-toe react app
- X should be in center of the square.

## eCommerce Example github prompts
 - can you help me get all tailwind color classes?
 - can you help me learn all inbuilt react hooks?
 - Copilot-Edit: 
    - create one webpage to welcome user in website
    - create a css file with clean styling for the welcome page

## Differences
- Copilot Edits is your go-to for fast, precise tweaks—think refactoring a function, squashing a bug, or applying consistent changes across files without losing your flow.
- Agent mode, on the other hand, steps up as your AI collaborator for thornier, multi-file challenges—analyzing your codebase, proposing architectural fixes, and even running terminal commands while you steer the ship and approve each move.

## Combining With Other Development Tools
- Agent mode works best as part of a broader toolset. Consider integrating it with:
    - Git operations for version control management
    - Project management tools for task tracking
    - Testing frameworks for automated quality assurance
    - Documentation generators for comprehensive technical documentation
