## CLAUDE is accurate if Fetch tool is also enabled
- Claude in the browser or Claude Desktop is extremely useful if it has fetch tool present.
- This allows it to pull the latest documentation or guides and provide accurate results.
- I found it gave better results for open-rewrite recipes when i specified the link to its documentation.
    - Example Prompt: 
    > read this document and explain step by step about authoring recipes in open rewrite, also include code samples. https://docs.openrewrite.org/authoring-recipes/writing-a-java-refactoring-recipe

## Add MCP servers if allowed
- In Corporates, if they allow MCP connections, one good option is to add Atlassian Confluence.
- With the power of confluence pages, its very easy to understand the "internal" workings of a technology.
- I personally got very good guides by adding MCP server.
