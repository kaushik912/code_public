Got it üëç ‚Äî if you usually **look at one work item at a time**, you can still calculate a **score on the fly** for that single item. The trick is to make the score **self-contained** so you don‚Äôt need to see all items at once.

Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

---

## 1. Use a consistent scoring formula

When you open an item, assign it points for each factor. For example:

* **Priority**: High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1
* **ETA (days left)**: `ScoreETA = 1 / DaysToDue` (closer due date ‚Üí bigger score)
* **Complexity**: Low = 3, Medium = 2, High = 1

Then combine:

```
Total Score = (Priority * 2) + (ScoreETA * 5) + (Complexity * 1)
```

*(Weights are just examples ‚Äî adjust to what matters most for you.)*

---

## 2. Store scores somewhere

* Keep a **simple table** (Excel, Google Sheet, Notion, even a notebook).
* Each time you open an item, calculate its score and write it down.
* You don‚Äôt need to compare in your head ‚Äî the scores will line up naturally.

---

## 3. Example (with your data)

Let‚Äôs assume today is **Sep 24, 2025**.

* **Sep 25, Medium complexity**

  * DaysToDue = 1 ‚Üí ScoreETA = 1/1 = 1
  * Priority = 3
  * Complexity = 2
  * Total = (3*2) + (1*5) + (2\*1) = 6 + 5 + 2 = **13**

* **Sep 26, Low complexity**

  * DaysToDue = 2 ‚Üí ScoreETA = 0.5
  * Priority = 3
  * Complexity = 3
  * Total = (3*2) + (0.5*5) + (3\*1) = 6 + 2.5 + 3 = **11.5**

* **Oct 3, High complexity**

  * DaysToDue = 9 ‚Üí ScoreETA = 0.11
  * Priority = 3
  * Complexity = 1
  * Total = (3*2) + (0.11*5) + (1\*1) = 6 + 0.55 + 1 = **7.55**

üëâ Highest = **Sep 25** (13) ‚Üí do first.

---

## 4. Benefits

* Works even if you only see **one item at a time**.
* Consistent scoring ‚Üí you can always compare later.
* You can tweak weights if you feel ETA or complexity should matter more.

Would you like me to design a **tiny one-line calculator** (e.g., in Excel or Google Sheets) where you just enter ETA, Priority, Complexity for a single item and it automatically spits out the score?
